# Introducing: Nomad
Nomad is a new design for radically cheaper cross-chain communication without header verification. Leveraging an Optimistic Fraud Proofs, Nomad will save on average, ~90% of gas costs compared to a traditional header relay.
Nomad features many properties that are most prized in optimistic mechanism design, such as  public verification, low gas fees and broad participation, but has a slightly different security model.

# The Nomad Platform

Nomad will form the base layer of a cross-chain communication network that provides fast, cheap communication for all smart contract chains and rollups. It relies only on widely-available cryptographic primitives (unlike header relays), has a latency of thirty minutes (rather than an ORUâ€™s one week latency), and imposes only about 120,000 gas overhead on message senders.
Nomad has been designed for ease of implementation in any blockchain that supports user-defined computations.
